# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    It was challenging, but it built my confidence in knowing that I can problem solve and apply things not explicitly taught.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    I think it is going pretty good so far.  I will have to make sure to keep time chunks alloted approriately when we enter mod1.  I am a little concerned about the time difference for me in EST, but I will able to get things done if I plan approriately.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    We will always continue to learn new things.
